# Firefox CSS for MacOS
A custom Firefox CSS that works well with the current MacOS design.  
It switches automatically between dark & light mode, depending on system settings.  
Changes only affect colors, a few margins and paddings - no repositionings.
Some colors still need to be adjusted, it's a work in progress.
I use this file on a daily basis, if some updates from Apple or Mozilla break the adjustments I will update the affected properties

## How to use
    
1. Open Firefox
2. Go into about:config
3. Set "toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets" to "true"
4. Go into about:profiles
5. Go to the root directory of your profile
6. Create an "chrome" folder
7. Place this file (userChrome.css) in the folder
8. Restart Firefox
